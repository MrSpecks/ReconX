## **Project Overview**  
In a digital age, security begins with information.  
**ReconX** is an open-source, powerful reconnaissance and OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) tool designed to streamline and automate the process of gathering critical information.  

Where others see data, **ReconX** sees patterns â€” patterns that lead to better decisions, enhanced security, and proactive measures.

## **Key Features**  
- **Domain and IP Reconnaissance (Phase 1)**  
  Unlock hidden insights into domains and IP addresses to evaluate risks, discover vulnerabilities, and gather key data in real-time.

- **OSINT Gathering (Coming Soon)**  
  A feature designed to collect intelligence from publicly available online sources, empowering security experts with information thatâ€™s otherwise difficult to obtain.

> "The more you know, the more you can anticipate. ReconX ensures you never miss the vital details."
